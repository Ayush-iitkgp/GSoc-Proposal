In other high-level languages, the users can not be developers because developing new packages in those language require the users to know the intricacies of low-level language whereas in Julia, users can develop packages for their needs in Julia itself without compromising with the speed.

    "# The Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem and Motivations\n",
    "The aim of the project is to add different optimization and bayesian techniques to estimate the parameterd of the differential equation in DiffEqParamEstim.jl package and do a comprehensive study of the pros and cons of the different algorithms to add it to the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential equation models are widely used in many scientific fields that include engineering, physics and biomedical sciences. The so-called “forward problem” that is the problem of solving differential equations for given parameter values in the differential equation models has been extensively studied by mathematicians, physicists, and engineers. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the **inverse problem**, the problem of parameter estimation based on the measurements of output variables, has not been well explored using modern optimization and statistical methods. Parameter estimation aims to find the unknown parameters of the model which give the best fit to a set of experimental data. In this way, parameters which cannot be measured directly will be determined in order to ensure the best fit of the model with the experimental results. This will be done by globally minimizing an objective function which measures the quality of the fit. This inverse problem usually considers a cost function to be optimized (such as maximum likelihood). This problem has applications in systems biology, HIV-AIDS study, and drug dosage estimation."

The **\"solve!\"** would be used to solve the SDP and a new instance of user-defined type **\"Solution\"** is created which has value of the primal and dual variables, status(Optimal, Unbounded), optimum value of the objective function stored in it in different fields. Now, when we have the solution of the real SDP, the next step is to transform the solution of the real SDP to its corresponding complex SDP. Also, the default setting in Convex.jl prints the output from solver(which we disable by passing in verbose=0), I would also need to change the setting so that the output from the solver is not displayed by default as we would not want the solution of the real SDP to be outputted to the user by default."

    "This step is exactly reverse of step 3. In this step, we use the transformation $\\tau^{-1}$ to obtain the solution of the complex SDP from the solution of the real SDP which is obtained in step 4. Lets us assume that the primal value of the variables of the real SDP is stored in temporary variable $Y$ which is a square matrix of order $2n$. As from the transformation $\\tau^{-1}$, it can be easily verified that first $n$ columns of first $n$ rows contain the real part of the complex matrix $X$ and the next $n$ columns contain negative the imaginary part of the matrix $X$. Also, the optimum value of the complex SDP is half the optimum value of the complex SDP. Thus, I would need to implement a new function which would take the primal values and the optimum values of the real SDP and convert to the corresponding complex SDP. This would be done by creating a function which would take the user-defined type **\"Solution\"** (this contains the solution for the real SDP) as an argument and convert it to complex-domain solution. I would also be required to make our solver intelligent so that it could distinguish between real and complex-domain SDPs. This would be done by creating a new field **\"domain\"** in the user-defined type **\"Solution\"** which would take values as either **real or complex**. If the the field **domain** contains value complex then the transformation $\\tau^{-1}$ would be called else no need."
