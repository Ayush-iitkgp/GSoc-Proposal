    "Hello, I am Ayush Pandey, a 4th year undergraduate student pursuing an Integrated Master of Science(MS) degree in Mathematics and Computing Sciences with micro-specialization in Optimization Theory and Applications\n",
    "at IIT Kharagpur, India. I am proficient in C, C++, Java and Python. I am moderately proficient in Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Previous Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "My first encounter with the field of optimization and operation research was during my 3rd year in the college when I took a course in Operation Research. As a part of the course, we were asked to code the Linear Programming methods ([source code](https://github.com/Ayush-iitkgp/Linear-Programming)). I enjoyed the course a lot and since then have been reading optimzation. I was also chosen to be a part of the IIT Kharagpur's contingent in [4th InterIIT TechMeet](http://interiittech.com/) where IIT Kharagpur won gold medal in Portfolio Optimization event where the participants had to present the solution for the Cardinality Constrained Efficient Frontier which we solved using 3 heuristic methods namely Genetic Algorithm, Tabu Search and Simulated Annealing ([source code](https://github.com/Ayush-iitkgp/InterIIT-TechMeet)).\n",

    "`1. What do you want to have completed by the end of the program?`\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the program, I want to add the support for complex-doamin optimization problelm in Convex.jl which presently only supports real-domain optimization problems.\n",

    "`2. Whoâ€™s interested in the work, and how will it benefit them?`\n",
    "\n",
    "Many problems in applied sciences are posed as optimization problems over the complex field such as Phase retrieval from sparse signals, designing an FIR filter given a desired frequency response.

The correct approach to such problem is to make existing packages like Convex.jl deal with complex-domain problems directly without converting them to real-domain problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "But the most anstonishing feature of Julia is that it is empowering. In other high-level languages, the users can not be developers becuase developing new packages in those language require the users to know the intricacies of low-level language whereas in Julia, users can develop packages for their needs in Julia itself without compromising with the speed.

    "Many problems in applied sciences are posed as optimization problems over the complex field such as Phase retrieval from sparse signals, designing an FIR filter given a desired frequency response.

This process can be time consuming and non-intuitive sometimes. The correct approach to such problem is to make existing packages deal with complex-domain problems. Thus, during this summer, I aim to implement the support for complex-domain optimization problems in Convex.jl.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the transformation used by Convex.jl to solve the semi-definite programming problem introduces many extra variables and constraints than are necessary which in turn makes Convex.jl slower. One approach to overcome this problem is writing a presolve routine similar to Linear Programming problems to remove the redundant and unnecessary variables and constraints before passing to the solvers thus making the existing package faster. The second part of the project will be dedicated to writing such presolve routines."

Lets us assume that the primal value of the variables of the real SDP is stored in temporary variable $Y$ which is a square matrix of order $2n$. As from the tranformation $\\tau^{-1}$, it can be easily verified that first $n$ columns of first $n$ rows contain the real part of the complex matrix $X$ and the next $n$ columns contain nagative the imaginary part of the matrix $X$.Also, the optimum value of the complex SDP is half the optimum value of the complex SDP. Thus, I would need to implement a new function which would take the primal values and the optimum values of the real SDP and convert to the corresponding complex SDP. This would be done by creating a function which would take the user-defined type **\"Solution\"** (this contains the solution for the real SDP) as an argument and convert it to complex-domain solution. I would also be required to make our solver intelligent so that it could distinuguish between real and complex-domain SDPs.
