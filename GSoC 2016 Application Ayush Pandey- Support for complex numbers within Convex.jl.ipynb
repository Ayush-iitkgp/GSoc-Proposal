    "\n",
    "Hello, I am Ayush Pandey, a 4th year undergraduate student pursuing an Integrated Master of Science(MS) degree in Mathematics and Computing Sciences with micro-specialization in Optimization Theory and Applications\n",
    "at IIT Kharagpur, India.  I'm proficient in C, C++, Java and Python. I'm moderately proficient in Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Previous Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "My first encounter with the field of optimization and operation research was during my 3rd year in the college when I took a course in Operation Research. As a part of the course, we were asked to code the Linear Programming methods ([source code](https://github.com/Ayush-iitkgp/Linear-Programming)). I enjoyed the course a lot and since then have been reading optimzation. I was also chosen to be a part of the IIT Kharagpur's contingent in [4th InterIIT TechMeet](http://interiittech.com/) where IIT Kharagpur won gold medal in Portfolio Optimization Event where the participants had to present the solution for the Cardinality Contrained Efficient Frontier which we solved using 3 heuristic methods namely Genetic Algorithm, Tabu Search and Simulated Annealing ([source code](https://github.com/Ayush-iitkgp/InterIIT-TechMeet)).\n",

    "## Experience with Julia\n",
    "I have been using Julia for last one and half month. In terms of functionality, I like Julia because of its **multiple dispatch** feature as it lets me overload operators with a lot of ease than other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the most anstonishing feature of Julia is that it is empowering. In other high-level languages, the users can not be developers becuase developing new packages in those language require the users to know the intricacies of low-level language whereas in Julia, users can develop packages for their needs in Julia itself without compromising with the speed.

    "The aim of the project is to add the support for solving complex domain optimization problems in Convex.jl (a Julia package for Disciplined Convex Programming).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many problems in applied sciences are posed as optimization problems over the complex field such as Phase retrieval from sparse signals, designing an FIR filter given a desired frequency response. The present approach is to manually convert the complex-domain problems to real-domain problems ([example](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cvxgrp/cvxpy/blob/master/examples/notebooks/WWW/fir_chebychev_design.ipynb)) and pass to solvers. This process can be time consuming and non-intuitive sometimes. The correct approach to such problem is to make existing packages deal with complex-domain problems. Thus, during this summer, I aim to implement the above functionality in Convex.jl."
